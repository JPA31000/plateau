# Plateau

This small arcade-style game is designed to help new hires memorize the main phases of a construction project. Catch each falling sign in the correct order to reinforce the sequence from feasibility studies through the project handover.

## Playing the Game

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser. You can double-click the file or drag it into an open browser window.
2. Use the **arrow keys** to move the truck: `←` moves left and `→` moves right.
3. Collect the phase panels in the proper order. If you pick the wrong one, a reminder shows which phase should come next.

## Scoring (coming soon)

A future update will keep track of points for each correct phase you collect in sequence. Finishing all phases quickly will lead to a higher score.
